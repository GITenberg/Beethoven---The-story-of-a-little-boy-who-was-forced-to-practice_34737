<p class="h2">HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</p>

<hr />

<p class="noindent">THIS book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN
BOOK OF GREAT MUSICIANS, written by Thomas
Tapper, author of "Pictures from the Lives of the Great Composers
for Children," "Music Talks with Children," "First
Studies in Music Biography," and others.</p>

<p>The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut
apart by the child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its
proper place throughout the book, pasted in the space containing
the same number as will be found under each picture on the
sheet. It is not necessary to cover the entire back of a picture
with paste. Put it only on the corners and place neatly within
the lines you will find printed around each space. Use photographic
paste, if possible.</p>

<p>After this play-work is completed there will be found at
the back of the book blank pages upon which the child is to
write his own story of the great musician, based upon the facts
and questions found on the previous pages.</p>

<p>The book is then to be sewed by the child through the
center with the cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book
thus becomes the child's own book.</p>

<p>This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and
interesting task for the children, but will teach them the main
facts with regard to the life of each of the great musicians&mdash;an
educational feature worth while.</p>

<p class="h2">The Story of a Little Boy who was
Forced to Practice</p>

<p>Ludwig van Beethoven was born in the lovely
town of Bonn, on the River Rhine, December 16, 1770.</p>

<p>The house in which he spent his boyhood is still
standing. We see in the picture what a pretty, homelike
place the house and the yard must have been. It
is now the Beethoven House, or Museum, filled with
mementos of the great composer. There you may see
music pages written by him, letters, medals, instruments;
even his ear trumpet is there.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="caption">THE BEETHOVEN HOUSE</span>
</div>

<p>Beethoven's father was a singer
at the Chapel of the Elector. He
was not a good father, for he did
not care to work even enough to
make his family comfortable.
But the mother loved her boy
with all her heart, as we shall see.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus03.jpg"  alt="BEETHOVEN&#39;S FATHER" title="BEETHOVEN&#39;S FATHER" /><br />
<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN&#39;S FATHER</span>
</div>

<p>Ludwig was only four years old
when he began to study music.
Like children of to-day he shed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
many a tear over the first lessons. In the beginning his
father taught him piano and violin, and forced him
to practice. At school he learned, just as we do to-day,
reading, writing, arithmetic, and later on, Latin.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus04.jpg"  alt="THE FIRST LESSON"
title="THE FIRST LESSON" /><br />
<span class="caption">THE FIRST LESSON</span>
</div>

<p>Never again after thirteen, did Ludwig go to
school for he had to work and earn his living.</p>

<p>Do you wonder what kind of a boy he was?</p>

<p>We are told that he was shy and quiet. He talked
little and took no interest in the games that his boy
and girl companions played.</p>

<p>While Ludwig was in school he played at a concert
for the first time. He was then eight years old.
Two years later he had composed quite a number of
pieces. One of these was printed. It was called
<i>Variations on Dressler's March</i>. On the title page of
this piece it said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="noindentcenter">VARIATIONS ON DRESSLER'S MARCH<br />
Composed by a Young Amateur<br />
LOUIS VAN BEETHOVEN<br />
Aged ten years. 1780</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
Then the little boy studied with a teacher named
Christian Gottlob Neefe, who took real interest in
him. Neefe did not, as was said of Beethoven's father,
punish the little boy severely to keep him at his practice,
hour after hour.</p>

<p>Often when Neefe had to travel Ludwig took his
teacher's place as organist at the Court. Then with
the organ lessons there were other lessons in Harmony.
So rapidly did the boy improve that his
teacher said one day:</p>

<p>"If he goes on as he has begun, he will some day
be a second Mozart."</p>

<p>Our young hero of thirteen was surely busy every
hour of the day. He played in an orchestra, as accompanist.
He gave lessons, played the organ in church,
studied the violin, and kept up his work in composition.
He always kept a note-book for musical ideas.</p>

<p>Most every child in
these days has more and
better opportunities than
had the great Beethoven
when he was a child.
Here is a picture of the
funny old organ in the
Minorite Church of Bonn
upon which Beethoven
played when he was a little
boy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus05.jpg"  alt="BEETHOVEN&#39;S ORGAN" title="BEETHOVEN&#39;S ORGAN" /><br />
<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN&#39;S ORGAN</span>
</div>

<p>Look at the funny stops
at the top and compare it
with the best organ in
your own town. This is
little better than a toy beside
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
our fine organs of to-day,&mdash;yet it was the best
that Beethoven had to practice upon.
When Neefe said that he would probably be a
second Mozart the words filled Ludwig with a great
desire. On his sixteenth birthday what do you think
happened? Why, he set out from Bonn to Vienna,
where Mozart lived.</p>

<p>But scarcely had he begun to feel at home in
Vienna when news came to him that his mother was
ill. She had always been a good mother, kind of heart,
great of hope for her little boy, and probably she
sympathized with the hard lot that made him have to
work so early in life. When he learned of her sickness
he hastened to Bonn.</p>

<p>Who was happier, he said to one of his friends,
than I, so long as I was able to speak the sweet name
of Mother and know that she heard me?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus06.jpg"  alt="BEETHOVEN&#39;S MOTHER" title="BEETHOVEN&#39;S MOTHER" /><br />
<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN&#39;S MOTHER</span>
</div>

<p>Vienna had given him a wonderful happiness.
He met Mozart and had some lessons from him in
composition. When he played for the great master,
Mozart tip-toed from the room and said softly to
those present:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
"Pay heed to this boy. He will surely make a
noise in the world some day."</p>

<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN AND MOZART</span>
</div>

<p>After his Mother's death he determined that he
would remain there. And it was not until he talked
with Joseph Haydn, who stopped at Bonn on his way
to London, that he decided once more to journey to
Vienna. Beethoven was twenty-two years old at the
time he met Papa Haydn. Beethoven showed the
master some of his compositions. Haydn urged him
to go at once to Vienna, promising to give him lessons
in composition on his return from London.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="caption">JOSEPH HAYDN</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Everywhere in Vienna Beethoven was a welcome
guest. He was proud (but in the right way), very
honest, always straightforward and independent.

But, like his mother, he was warm-hearted and as
true as could be. There was nothing in his nature
that was mean, or cruel, or wrong in any way. He
took pride in his talent and worked hard to perfect
himself in it.</p>

<p>Here is what Beethoven's handwriting looked
like.</p>

</div>

<p>Bit by bit, the great power of Beethoven as a
pianist became known. He played much among his
friends, but he did not like to perform in public.</p>

<p>A story is told that once he was to play his C major
Concerto at a concert. When he arrived at the hall
he found the piano was tuned so low that he had to
play the Concerto in C# major.</p>

<p>You know how hard it is to transpose a simple
piece, but think of transposing a Concerto and playing
it with orchestra without time for practice!</p>

<p>Do you sometimes wonder what the great composer
looked like? Beethoven lived outside of Vienna
and often took long walks in the country. Once a
little boy ten years of age was taken by his father to
visit Beethoven. The boy must have been a very observant
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
boy for he wrote out a description of how
Beethoven looked. This is the little boy's picture as
a man:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg"  alt="CARL CZERNY" title="CARL CZERNY" /><br />
<span class="caption">CARL CZERNY</span>
</div>

<p>And this is the description he gave of Beethoven.</p>

<p>"Beethoven was dressed in a dark gray jacket and
trousers of some long-haired material, which reminded
me of the description of Robinson Crusoe I
had just been reading. The jet-black hair stood upright
on his head. A beard, unshaven for several
days, made still darker his naturally swarthy face. I
noticed also, with a child's quick perception, that he
had cotton wool which seemed to have been dipped
in some yellow fluid in both ears. His hands were covered
with hair, and the fingers were very broad, especially
at the tips."</p>

<p>You know, of course, that when we think of music
we think of <i>hearing</i> it. We think how it <i>sounds</i> to us.
A lover of music loves
to hear its <i>tones</i> and to feel
its <i>rhythm</i>.</p>

<p>Like every other human being, Beethoven loved
music in just this way. He loved its sounds as they
fell on the ear. As colors delight our eyes, so tones
fell with delight upon the ears of this man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>Beethoven was once
invited to play at the
home of a nobleman,
but upon being informed
that he would be
expected to go as a
menial, he indignantly
rejected the proposal.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ANGRY BEETHOVEN</span>
</div>

<p>Beethoven had many
friends and was fond
of them. They knew
that he was a genius
and were glad to forget
some of the very
strange things that he
did when he got angry. Here is a picture of the great
master seated among a group of his friends. Although
Beethoven was odd, his friends loved him.</p>

<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN PLAYING FOR HIS FRIENDS</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
But a strange Fate touched him and took away
his sense of hearing. From the time he was about
thirty years old his hearing grew gradually worse.
Indeed it was necessary for him to have a piano especially
constructed with additional wires so that he
could hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
And yet he went on day, after day, composing
beautiful music as he walked the fields, or as he sat
at his table. For we must remember that he could
hear his own music in his thoughts. That is, the mind
that made the music could hear it, though the ear itself
was forever closed to the sound of it.</p>

<p>Year after year he continued to write symphonies
and concertos, sonatas, songs, choral and chamber
music.</p>

<p>And year after year the poor ears closed a little
more and still a little more, until finally not even the
loudest noises could penetrate them.</p>

<p>And yet he worked bravely; writing every beautiful
music thought that came to him, so that the
world, and that means you and all of us, might have
them. When Beethoven was dying in 1827, Schubert
called upon him and remained with him for some time.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
